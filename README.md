# plant-manager-app
<h2>App developed during the Next Level Week #5, organized and distributed by Rocketseat.</h2>
To run this project and see the different visual features that we added during the week, it'll be necessary to have some things installed:

- Node.js
- Yarn or NPM
- Expo-cli
- Android or IOS emulator

<h3>First, you'll have to run <code>yarn</code> in the terminal of your project, to install the node_modules that I used.</h3>

<h3>Before running an <code>expo start</code>, it's necessary to have the expo-cli installed and install all the dependencies used in the application.</h3>
